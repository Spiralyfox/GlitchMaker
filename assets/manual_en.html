<h1>🎵 Glitch Maker — User Manual</h1>

<p>Glitch Maker is a creative audio effects workstation for sound design, glitch art and musical experimentation. This manual covers every feature of the software: what it does, how to use it, and what it sounds like.</p>

<!-- ═══════════════════════════════════ -->
<h2>🖥️ Interface Overview</h2>

<p>The interface is divided into three main columns:</p>

<p><b>Left panel — Effects</b>: Lists all 27 available effects organized by category. Use the search bar to filter, click an effect to apply it. Star your favorites for quick access. Toggle between effects (FX) and presets (PR) views.</p>

<p><b>Center — Waveform &amp; Timeline</b>: The main workspace. The top shows the audio waveform where you can select regions, place markers, and see the playhead. Below it is the timeline showing clips as colored blocks. Between them is the transport bar (Play/Pause/Stop, time display, volume). A real-time spectrum analyzer sits at the bottom-right of the waveform area.</p>

<p><b>Right panel — Effect History</b>: Every effect you apply appears here as a card. You can toggle each effect on/off (eye icon), delete it (trash icon), or use Ctrl+Z/Ctrl+Y to undo/redo. Effects are applied in order from top to bottom.</p>

<!-- ═══════════════════════════════════ -->
<h2>📂 Loading &amp; Saving Audio</h2>

<p><b>File &gt; Open</b> (or drag &amp; drop) — Load MP3, WAV, FLAC, OGG, or any format supported by FFmpeg. The waveform and timeline update immediately.</p>

<p><b>File &gt; Save / Save As</b> — Export the processed audio. Choose WAV for lossless quality or MP3/FLAC/OGG for compressed formats. The entire effect chain is baked into the output.</p>

<p><b>File &gt; Record</b> — Record audio directly from your input device. A recording dialog appears with level metering. Press Stop to finish and the recorded audio loads into the workspace.</p>

<div class="tip">💡 FFmpeg is downloaded automatically on first launch if it's not found on your system. This enables MP3, FLAC and OGG support.</div>

<!-- ═══════════════════════════════════ -->
<h2>▶️ Playback &amp; Transport</h2>

<p>The transport bar at the bottom of the center panel controls playback:</p>

<p><b>PLAY / PAUSE button</b> — Click to start playback. While playing, the button changes to PAUSE. Clicking PAUSE freezes playback at the current position. Pressing Play again (or <kbd>Space</kbd>) resumes from where you paused. This is useful for listening carefully to a specific moment.</p>

<p><b>STOP button</b> — Stops playback and returns the playhead to its starting position: the blue anchor if one is set, the start of the selection if one exists, or the very beginning of the file.</p>

<p><b>Automatic looping</b> — When there is no red selection and playback reaches the end of the file, it loops back to the beginning automatically instead of stopping. If a selection exists, playback loops within that selection.</p>

<p><b>Volume slider</b> — Adjusts output volume from 0% to 100%. The percentage is displayed next to the slider.</p>

<p><b>Time display</b> — Shows current position / total duration in MM:SS.ms format.</p>

<p><b>Selection info</b> — When a region is selected, the duration of the selection is shown (e.g. "Sel: 00:01.25").</p>

<!-- ═══════════════════════════════════ -->
<h2>🎯 Waveform &amp; Selection</h2>

<p><b>Blue anchor</b> — Click anywhere on the waveform to place a <b style="color:#3b82f6">blue anchor line</b>. Playback starts from there. When you press Stop, the playhead returns to the anchor. Think of it as a "start from here" bookmark.</p>

<p><b>Red selection</b> — Click and drag on the waveform to select a region (shown in red). Effects will only apply to the selected zone. If no selection is made, effects apply to the entire audio.</p>

<p><b>Smart selection during playback</b> — If audio is already playing and you start dragging to create a selection, playback automatically pauses. When you release the mouse, playback resumes inside the newly selected zone. A simple click (without dragging) repositions the anchor and resumes from there.</p>

<p><b>Right-click menu</b> — Right-click inside a selection to access cut options:</p>
<p>• <b>Cut — Replace with silence</b>: the selected region becomes silent. The clip splits into 3 parts (before, silence, after).<br>
• <b>Cut — Delete &amp; splice</b>: the selected region is removed and the remaining parts are joined. The audio becomes shorter.</p>

<p><b>Waveform zoom</b> — Scroll the mouse wheel over the waveform to zoom in/out horizontally. A minimap appears above the waveform showing your current viewport. Click and drag the minimap to scroll through the zoomed waveform.</p>

<!-- ═══════════════════════════════════ -->
<h2>🎼 Timeline</h2>

<p>The timeline sits below the waveform and displays your audio as colored clip blocks. Each time you apply an effect to a selection, a new clip is created showing exactly which portion was affected.</p>

<p><b>Click on the timeline</b> to jump to any position. Click on a clip to select it (highlighted border).</p>

<p><b>Timeline zoom</b> — Scroll the mouse wheel over the timeline to zoom in/out independently from the waveform. A horizontal scrollbar appears below the timeline when zoomed in.</p>

<p><b>Time markers</b> — The timeline header shows time markers (00:00.00, 00:00.50, etc.) that scale with zoom level.</p>

<!-- ═══════════════════════════════════ -->
<h2>📌 Markers</h2>

<p>Press <kbd>M</kbd> to add a marker at the current playhead position. Markers appear as vertical lines on the waveform and are useful for bookmarking important moments.</p>

<p><b>Navigate</b>: <kbd>Ctrl+→</kbd> jumps to the next marker, <kbd>Ctrl+←</kbd> to the previous one.</p>

<p><b>Delete</b>: Right-click on the waveform near a marker to access marker options.</p>

<!-- ═══════════════════════════════════ -->
<h2>🎵 Metronome &amp; Beat Grid</h2>

<p>Click the <b>Metronome</b> button in the toolbar to toggle it on/off. The metronome plays click sounds synchronized with the audio at the specified BPM. The beat grid draws vertical lines on the waveform aligned to beats, helping you time your edits musically.</p>

<p>Open <b>Options &gt; Metronome</b> to configure:</p>
<p>• <b>Enable/Disable</b> — Toggle the metronome click sound.<br>
• <b>BPM</b> — Type a number directly (20–300) to set the tempo.<br>
• <b>Volume</b> — Slider with live percentage display to control metronome loudness.</p>

<div class="audio-desc">🔊 The metronome produces a short, sharp click on each beat. At 120 BPM, you'll hear 2 clicks per second. The beat grid on the waveform helps you visually align your selections to musical beats.</div>

<!-- ═══════════════════════════════════ -->
<h2>🔊 Spectrum Analyzer</h2>

<p>The real-time spectrum analyzer is displayed in the bottom-right area during playback. It shows the frequency content of the audio as a bar graph, from low frequencies (bass) on the left to high frequencies (treble) on the right. This helps you visualize the sonic impact of your effects.</p>

<!-- ═══════════════════════════════════ -->
<h2>🎛️ Effects — Complete Reference</h2>

<p>To apply an effect: optionally select a region on the waveform, then click the effect in the left panel. A dialog opens with parameters. Adjust to taste and click Apply. The effect appears in the history panel on the right.</p>

<div class="tip">💡 If no region is selected, the effect applies to the entire audio file.</div>

<!-- ── Basics ── -->
<h3>📦 Basics</h3>

<p><b>Reverse</b> — Flips the audio backwards. No parameters needed.</p>
<div class="audio-desc">🔊 A vocal recording played in reverse sounds like an alien language — syllables become smeared, attacks become decays. A drum hit becomes a rising swell. Reverse is the foundation of many glitch and ambient techniques.</div>

<p><b>Volume</b> — Adjusts the loudness of the audio. Parameter: gain (dB).</p>
<div class="audio-desc">🔊 Boost to make a quiet section louder, or reduce to create a fade-out effect. Extreme boost (>12dB) will cause distortion clipping, which can be a desired creative effect.</div>

<p><b>Filter</b> — Applies a frequency filter. Parameters: filter type (low-pass, high-pass, band-pass), cutoff frequency (Hz), resonance (Q).</p>
<div class="audio-desc">🔊 A low-pass filter removes high frequencies, making the sound muffled like hearing music through a wall. A high-pass filter removes bass, making it thin and tinny like a phone speaker. Band-pass isolates a narrow frequency range, creating a "telephone" or "walkie-talkie" effect. High resonance (Q) creates a sharp peak at the cutoff, adding a whistling or ringing quality.</div>

<p><b>Pan / Stereo</b> — Moves the audio in the stereo field. Parameter: pan position (left to right).</p>
<div class="audio-desc">🔊 Hard left pan makes the sound come only from the left speaker. Center keeps it balanced. Automating pan creates a sense of movement, as if the sound is flying from one ear to the other.</div>

<!-- ── Pitch & Time ── -->
<h3>🎵 Pitch &amp; Time</h3>

<p><b>Pitch Shift</b> — Changes the pitch without affecting speed. Parameter: semitones (-12 to +12).</p>
<div class="audio-desc">🔊 Shifting up +12 semitones (one octave) makes a voice sound like a chipmunk. Shifting down -12 makes it deep and booming like a giant. Small shifts (±1-3) create subtle harmonizing or detuning effects. Extreme values create robotic, alien textures.</div>

<p><b>Time Stretch</b> — Changes the speed without affecting pitch. Parameter: stretch factor.</p>
<div class="audio-desc">🔊 A factor of 2.0 makes the audio twice as slow — a 1-second clip becomes 2 seconds while keeping the same pitch. Factor 0.5 makes it twice as fast. Extreme stretching (4x+) creates dreamy, ambient pads from any source material.</div>

<p><b>Tape Stop</b> — Simulates a tape deck slowing down to a stop. Parameter: duration.</p>
<div class="audio-desc">🔊 The audio gradually slows down while the pitch drops lower and lower, like unplugging a turntable while a record is playing. A short duration (0.2s) creates a quick "DJ brake" effect. Longer durations (2s+) create a dramatic, eerie slowdown.</div>

<p><b>Autotune</b> — Snaps the pitch to the nearest musical note. Parameters: key, correction strength.</p>
<div class="audio-desc">🔊 At full strength, every note snaps perfectly to pitch — creating the robotic vocal effect popularized in modern music. At lower strength, it gently corrects pitch while sounding natural. Works best on monophonic sources (single voice or instrument).</div>

<p><b>Pitch Drift (Wave Ondulée)</b> — Creates a wavy pitch modulation. Parameters: speed, depth.</p>
<div class="audio-desc">🔊 The pitch gently wobbles up and down like a warped vinyl record or a drunk singer. Fast speed with shallow depth sounds like vibrato. Slow speed with deep depth sounds like a cassette tape being stretched and released.</div>

<!-- ── Distortion ── -->
<h3>🔥 Distortion</h3>

<p><b>Saturation</b> — Adds warm harmonic distortion. Parameter: drive amount.</p>
<div class="audio-desc">🔊 Light saturation adds warmth and presence, like running audio through a vintage tube amplifier. Heavy saturation makes the sound thick, fuzzy and aggressive — turning a clean guitar into a grungy roar.</div>

<p><b>Distortion</b> — Hard clipping distortion. Parameter: drive, tone.</p>
<div class="audio-desc">🔊 Harsher than saturation — it aggressively clips the signal peaks, creating a buzzy, crunchy texture. At extreme settings, any input becomes a wall of harsh noise. Great for making drums sound explosive or vocals sound demonic.</div>

<p><b>Bitcrusher</b> — Reduces bit depth and/or sample rate. Parameters: bit depth, sample rate reduction.</p>
<div class="audio-desc">🔊 Lowering bit depth to 8 or 4 bits makes audio sound like an old video game console — grainy, crunchy, digital. Reducing sample rate adds aliasing artifacts — metallic, buzzy overtones that weren't in the original. At extreme settings (2-bit, very low sample rate), any sound becomes an unrecognizable digital scream.</div>

<!-- ── Modulation ── -->
<h3>🌊 Modulation</h3>

<p><b>Chorus</b> — Doubles the signal with slight pitch/time variation. Parameters: rate, depth, mix.</p>
<div class="audio-desc">🔊 Creates the illusion of multiple voices or instruments playing together, like a choir. The sound becomes wider, richer and shimmer-y. Light chorus adds subtle thickness. Heavy chorus creates a watery, swirling texture.</div>

<p><b>Phaser</b> — Sweeps a series of notch filters through the audio. Parameters: rate, depth, stages.</p>
<div class="audio-desc">🔊 Creates a sweeping, swooshing sound — like a jet plane flying overhead. The effect cycles through peaks and notches in the frequency spectrum. Classic on guitars and synth pads. More stages = more dramatic, spacey sweeping.</div>

<p><b>Tremolo</b> — Rapid volume modulation. Parameters: rate (Hz), depth.</p>
<div class="audio-desc">🔊 The volume pulses up and down rhythmically, like someone rapidly turning the volume knob. Slow rates (2-4 Hz) create a gentle pulsing. Fast rates (10-20 Hz) create a machine-gun stuttering effect. At extreme rates, it becomes a ring modulation-like buzzing.</div>

<p><b>Ring Mod</b> — Multiplies the signal with a sine wave. Parameter: frequency (Hz).</p>
<div class="audio-desc">🔊 Creates metallic, inharmonic, alien-sounding tones. Low frequencies (20-50 Hz) add a buzzy tremolo. Medium frequencies (200-500 Hz) create robotic, Dalek-like voices. High frequencies (1000+ Hz) produce bell-like, shimmering metallic textures.</div>

<!-- ── Space & Texture ── -->
<h3>🌌 Space &amp; Texture</h3>

<p><b>Delay</b> — Repeats the audio after a time gap. Parameters: delay time (ms), feedback, mix.</p>
<div class="audio-desc">🔊 A single short delay (50-100ms) creates a "slapback" echo like singing in a tiled bathroom. Longer delays (300-500ms) create distinct rhythmic echoes. High feedback makes the echoes repeat many times, building up into a wash of sound that can spiral into infinite feedback.</div>

<p><b>Vinyl</b> — Simulates vinyl record imperfections. Parameters: crackle, warble, noise.</p>
<div class="audio-desc">🔊 Adds the cozy, nostalgic character of a vinyl record — pops, crackles, surface noise, and subtle pitch warble. Light settings make your audio sound like it's being played from an old record player. Heavy settings make it sound like a damaged, dusty record found in an attic.</div>

<p><b>OTT (Over The Top)</b> — Multi-band upward/downward compression. Parameters: amount, bands.</p>
<div class="audio-desc">🔊 Makes everything louder, punchier and more "in your face". Quiet parts get boosted, loud parts get tamed. At full strength, every detail of the audio becomes equally loud — breathing, room noise, transients — creating an intense, hyper-compressed sound popular in electronic music.</div>

<p><b>Robotic Voice</b> — Vocoder-style robotic transformation. Parameters: carrier frequency, formant.</p>
<div class="audio-desc">🔊 Transforms any audio into a robotic, synthetic version of itself. Voices become monotone and metallic, like a robot or computer speaking. Musical instruments gain a synthetic, electronic quality.</div>

<p><b>Hyper</b> — Extreme multiband enhancement. Parameter: intensity.</p>
<div class="audio-desc">🔊 Pushes the audio into an aggressively enhanced, almost surreal state. Bass gets thicker, mids get more present, highs get more sparkly. At high intensity, the sound becomes almost uncomfortably vivid and energetic.</div>

<!-- ── Glitch ── -->
<h3>⚡ Glitch</h3>

<p><b>Stutter</b> — Repeats tiny fragments rapidly. Parameters: stutter size (ms), repeat count.</p>
<div class="audio-desc">🔊 Chops the audio into tiny pieces and repeats each one — creating a "b-b-b-b-b-broken record" effect. Short stutters (10-50ms) create machine-gun rhythmic patterns. Longer stutters (100-200ms) create more musical, beat-repeat-style effects. A classic glitch technique.</div>

<p><b>Granular</b> — Breaks audio into tiny grains and rearranges them. Parameters: grain size, scatter, pitch randomization.</p>
<div class="audio-desc">🔊 The audio is shattered into microscopic pieces (grains) and reassembled in new ways. Small grains with high scatter create a cloud-like, ambient texture — the original sound dissolves into a shimmering mist. Larger grains with less scatter create a "frozen" or "crystallized" version of the sound.</div>

<p><b>Shuffle</b> — Randomly reorders chunks of audio. Parameters: chunk size, randomness.</p>
<div class="audio-desc">🔊 Cuts the audio into blocks and rearranges them randomly — like cutting a cassette tape into pieces and taping them back together in random order. Small chunks create chaotic, glitchy patterns. Large chunks create a surreal, mixed-up version of the original.</div>

<p><b>Buffer Freeze</b> — Captures and loops a tiny buffer. Parameters: buffer size, freeze position.</p>
<div class="audio-desc">🔊 Grabs a tiny fragment of audio and loops it endlessly, creating a sustained, frozen moment in time. Short buffers (5-20ms) create a buzzy, tonal drone from any source material. Longer buffers (50-200ms) create a recognizable loop of the original content.</div>

<p><b>Datamosh</b> — Corrupts the audio data deliberately. Parameters: corruption amount, block size.</p>
<div class="audio-desc">🔊 Intentionally breaks the audio data, creating digital artifacts, glitches, pops and unexpected textures. Light datamoshing adds subtle digital imperfections. Heavy datamoshing turns the audio into a chaotic mess of digital noise and fragmented remnants of the original — true audio destruction.</div>

<p><b>Vocal Chop</b> — Chops audio into rhythmic segments. Parameters: chop pattern, gate.</p>
<div class="audio-desc">🔊 Slices the audio into rhythmic pieces and applies silence between them, creating a choppy, rhythmic pattern. Applied to vocals, it creates the classic "chopped vocal" effect used in EDM and pop. Applied to instruments, it creates rhythmic gating effects.</div>

<p><b>Tape Glitch</b> — Simulates damaged tape playback. Parameters: glitch frequency, severity.</p>
<div class="audio-desc">🔊 Mimics a malfunctioning cassette player — random speed fluctuations, dropouts (brief silences), and warbling. Light settings add vintage character. Heavy settings sound like a tape deck eating your cassette — the audio stutters, warps, and briefly disappears in unpredictable ways.</div>
